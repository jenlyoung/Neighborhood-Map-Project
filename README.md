<h1> Neighborhood Map Project</h1>

<p> Welcome to my Neighborhood Map Project! This map was designed as part of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree </p>
<p> This map was created using Google Maps API and data from the Foursqaure API. </p>

<h2> How It Works</h2>

<ul>
    <li> This map shows 10 fun venues located in Wildwood Town Square, WildWood, MO.</li>
    <li> Click on any maker to see the name and address of the indicated location. </li>
    <li> Click on the hamburger icon to reveal a list of all 10 locations. </li>
    <li> Use the search button to filter the list by name.</li>
</ul>
